<p>
  Hearst Castle is a National Historic Landmark and California Historical Landmark mansion designed
  and built for newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst.  Located by San Simeon, Hearst Castle
  is actually a cluster of mansions rather than a single castle.  Hearst Castle was begun in 1919
  and finished in 1947, though its owner died in 1951.  The estate is formally named "La Cuesta Encantada"
  ("The Enchanted Hill"), though some refer to it as "the ranch" or "San Simeon."
